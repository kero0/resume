This repository contains the source code for my resume. The body of my resume is written in [[./resume.org][org-mode]]. The source code is then converted to LaTeX and then a PDF using emacs and nix. The source code is then pushed to github and the PDF is automatically generated using github actions.

If you want to use this repository as a template for your own resume, you can fork it and then edit the resume.org file. You can then use the following commands to generate the PDF.

- *nix*
  1. Build with nix
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    nix build .
    #+END_SRC
  2. The resulting PDF will be in =./result/resume.pdf=.

- *emacs* and *xelatex*
  1. Use emacs to open =resume.org=. You can optionally accept the file local variable to automatically export the LaTeX file every time you save the file.
  2. Run =org-latex-export-to-latex=. (if you accepted the file local variable, this will happen automatically)
  3. Run =xelatex= on the resulting =resume.tex= file.
  #+begin_src sh
  xelatex resume.tex
  #+end_src
